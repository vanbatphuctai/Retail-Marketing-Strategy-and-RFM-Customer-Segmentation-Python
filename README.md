## 📌 Background & Overview  
### 🌍 Global SuperStore - Business Context

**SuperStore** is a multinational retail company operating across multiple global markets with a **large and diverse customer base**.

As transaction volume continues to scale, traditional **manual segmentation methods** (previously handled in Excel) are no longer feasible. Meanwhile, customers increasingly expect **personalized engagement** instead of mass marketing campaigns.

During the **Christmas and New Year season**, the Marketing Department aimed to:

- **Reward loyal customers**
- **Re-engage inactive customers**
- **Identify potential high-value customers**
- **Optimize campaign targeting efficiency**

However, due to the size of the dataset, segmentation needed to be **automated and scalable**.

The Data Analytics team was tasked with building a **Python-based RFM segmentation pipeline** to support a **data-driven marketing strategy**.

---

### 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project was to design and implement a **scalable RFM (Recency – Frequency – Monetary) segmentation framework** that:

- **Identifies high-value and loyal customers**
- **Detects early churn-risk segments**
- **Supports targeted campaign execution**
- **Establishes the foundation for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) strategy**

---

### 📌 RFM Framework Definition

The **RFM model** evaluates customer behavior using transactional data:

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes purchases  
- **Monetary (M):** How much revenue the customer generates  

Rather than treating RFM as a simple scoring table, this project positions it as a **behavior-based analytical foundation** for **long-term customer strategy**.

---

### ❗ Why RFM Over Traditional Segmentation

Traditional segmentation methods such as demographic grouping or total revenue ranking are often **static and assumption-driven**.

RFM provides stronger business value because it:

- Uses **actual transactional behavior**
- Enables **scalable segmentation for large datasets**
- Provides **clear retention and prioritization logic**
- Supports advanced modeling such as:
  - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
  - **Churn prediction**
  - **Survival analysis**

It bridges the gap between **descriptive reporting** and **predictive customer analytics**.

---

### 🛠 Technical Implementation

The segmentation workflow was implemented in **Python**, including:

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
- **Aggregation of transaction-level data into customer-level metrics**
- **Calculation of R, F, and M values**
- **Scoring and quantile-based segmentation**
- **Segment labeling and business interpretation**

The final output was a **structured customer segmentation dataset** ready for:

- **CRM integration**
- **Marketing automation**
- **Dashboard visualization**
- **Campaign targeting**

---

### 👥 Stakeholders

- **Senior Management**
- **Marketing & CRM Team**
- **Strategy & Growth Team**
- **Business & Data Analysts**

---

### ❓ Key Business Questions Answered

- Which customer segments generate the **highest revenue**?
- Which customers show **declining engagement patterns**?
- How should **marketing budget** be prioritized across segments?
- How can transactional data support **long-term CLV optimization**?

---

### 📊 Project Outcomes

The RFM framework successfully:

- **Identified high-value loyal customers**
- **Detected at-risk and inactive customers**
- **Improved targeting precision for seasonal campaigns**
- **Enabled scalable, automated segmentation using Python**
- **Established analytical groundwork for advanced customer modeling**

This project demonstrates the practical application of **behavioral analytics** to support **personalized marketing at scale** in a global retail environment.

### Summary

⚡ Initial exploration revealed several data quality issues, including **negative values in Quantity and UnitPrice, missing CustomerID (~135K records), duplicate transactions, and inconsistencies between StockCode and Description**.  
These issues require validation and cleaning before reliable analysis.

#### ⚡ Data Quality Insights
A mismatch was observed between **StockCode (4070)** and **Description (4223)** counts, indicating potential inconsistencies such as:

- Multiple descriptions for the same product  
- Missing or duplicated product identifiers  
- Manually entered or inconsistent product names  

Further validation is required to ensure data consistency.

#### ⚠ Manual Review Required
Some orders contain **incorrect or inconsistent descriptions** → These records should be manually reviewed and flagged as errors.

#### 🔎 Data Validation & Error Identification
- Checked **description mismatches** between StockCode and Description  
- Verified **negative Quantity values** against cancellations (`InvoiceNo` starting with **"C"**)  
→ Flagged suspicious transactions for further validation.

### ✨ Conclusion

**Data Types:** Convert the following columns to string:

- InvoiceNo  
- StockCode  
- Description  
- CustomerID  
- Country  

**Data Values:**

- **Quantity < 0 & InvoiceNo starts with "C"** → Canceled orders → remove  
- **Quantity < 0 but InvoiceNo does not start with "C"** → Invalid records → remove  
- **UnitPrice < 0 or incorrect descriptions** → Invalid transactions → remove

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After completing the initial data inspection, the dataset `ecommerce_retail` was cleaned and prepared for analytical tasks.

#### 🛠 Step 1: Convert to Correct Data Types

To ensure proper grouping and time-based analysis, identifier columns were converted to string format and the date column was standardized.

[In 5]:

```python
# Convert identifier columns to string type
column_list = ["InvoiceNo", "StockCode", "Description", "CustomerID", "Country"]

for col in column_list:
    ecommerce_retail[col] = ecommerce_retail[col].astype(str)

# Convert InvoiceDate to datetime format
ecommerce_retail["InvoiceDate"] = pd.to_datetime(ecommerce_retail["InvoiceDate"])
```


#### 🛠 Step 2: Remove Invalid Transactions

To ensure revenue accuracy, invalid records were removed using business logic rules.

[In 6]:

```python
# 1. Remove canceled invoices (InvoiceNo starting with "C")
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[
    ~ecommerce_retail["InvoiceNo"].str.startswith("C")]

# 2. Remove negative quantity transactions
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[
    ecommerce_retail["Quantity"] > 0]

# 3. Remove negative unit prices
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[
    ecommerce_retail["UnitPrice"] > 0]
```

### Business Logic

- Invoices starting with **"C"** represent cancellations (credit notes)
- Negative quantities indicate returns or incorrect entries
- Negative unit prices are financially invalid

Only valid sales transactions were retained.


#### 🛠 Step 3: Handle Missing CustomerID

Customer-level analysis requires valid customer identifiers.

[In 7]:

```python
import missingno as msno
import numpy as np

# Visualize missing data
msno.matrix(ecommerce_retail)

# Standardize missing formats
ecommerce_retail["CustomerID"] = (
    ecommerce_retail["CustomerID"]
    .replace(["nan", "", " "], np.nan))

# Missing value summary
missing_summary = pd.DataFrame({
    "volume": ecommerce_retail.isnull().sum(),
    "%": (ecommerce_retail.isnull().sum() / ecommerce_retail.shape[0]) * 100})

print(missing_summary)
```

[Out 7]:

<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91806737-394f-46b2-bb3b-b024ac57aad7" />


#### Investigation Findings

Missing `CustomerID` values were not concentrated in specific countries or time periods, suggesting general recording issues rather than systematic bias.

#### Final Decision

Since `CustomerID` is critical for customer segmentation and RFM analysis:

[In 8]

```python
# Remove transactions with missing CustomerID to ensure valid customer-level analysis
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail.dropna(subset=["CustomerID"])
```

All transactions without valid customer identifiers were removed.


#### 🛠 Step 4: Handle Duplicate Records

Duplicate rows were identified based on:

- `InvoiceNo`
- `StockCode`
- `InvoiceDate`
- `CustomerID`

[In 9]:

```python
# Identify duplicate rows based on 'InvoiceNo', 'StockCode', 'InvoiceDate', and 'CustomerID'

ecommerce_duplicate = ecommerce_retail[
    ecommerce_retail.duplicated(
        subset=["InvoiceNo", "StockCode", "InvoiceDate", "CustomerID"])]
```

If duplicates exist, they are handled in two cases:

#### Case 1:  Identical Duplicates

- Same invoice, product, customer, date, and quantity  
- Likely caused by system duplication  
➝ Removed

#### Case 2:  Same Transaction but Different Quantities

- Same invoice & product but recorded in separate rows  
- Likely order split issue  
➝ Quantities aggregated to maintain revenue accuracy

## 🧮 Apply RFM Model

#### 🛠 Step 1: RFM Feature Engineering

[In 10]:

```python
# Set the reference date for calculating Recency as December 31, 2011
last_date = pd.to_datetime('12/31/2011')

# Calculate the Revenue column
ecommerce_retail['Revenue'] = ecommerce_retail['Quantity'] * ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice']

# Create RFM df
rfm = ecommerce_retail.groupby('CustomerID').agg(
    Recency=("InvoiceDate", lambda x: (last_date - x.max()).days), # Calculate the number of days since the last purchase
    Frequency=("InvoiceNo", "nunique"), # Count the number of transactions per customer
    Monetary=("Revenue", "sum") # Sum the total revenue per customer
).reset_index()

#Check
rfm.head()
```

[Out 10]:

<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9f50de5-d2fa-4f7d-b588-21d9171286a4" />


#### 🛠 Step 2: Check outlier

[In 11]:

```python
# Create 1 row, 3 columns
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

# Check outliers for the 'Recency' column
sns.boxplot(data=rfm, x='Recency', ax=axes[0])
axes[0].set_title('Recency Outliers')

# Check outliers for the 'Frequency' column
sns.boxplot(data=rfm, x='Frequency', ax=axes[1])
axes[1].set_title('Frequency Outliers')

# Check outliers for the 'Monetary' column
sns.boxplot(data=rfm, x='Monetary', ax=axes[2])
axes[2].set_title('Monetary Outliers')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

[Out 11]:

<img width="1050" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d996e0-1f1a-4a2d-bb33-43f94a45ded8" />

📌 **Solution**

The boxplots show the presence of **extreme values** and **right-skewed distributions**, especially in **Frequency** and **Monetary**.

To ensure more **reliable analysis**, a **95th percentile threshold** will be applied to **remove extreme outliers**.  
This allows the analysis to focus on the **majority of customers** and prevents **distortion caused by unusually large values**.

#### 🛠 Step 2.1: Outlier Treatment using 95th Percentile

[In 12]:

```python
# Apply 95th percentile cap
rfm['Frequency'] = rfm['Frequency'].clip(upper=rfm['Frequency'].quantile(0.95))
rfm['Monetary'] = rfm['Monetary'].clip(upper=rfm['Monetary'].quantile(0.95))
```

#### 🛠 Step 3: Assign RFM scores using Qcut

[In 13]:

```python
# Recency score: Lower values indicate more recent purchases, so assign higher scores to lower recency values
rfm['R_Score'] = pd.qcut(rfm['Recency'], 5, labels = [5,4,3,2,1])

# Frequency score: Higher values indicate more frequent purchases, so assign higher scores to higher frequency values
rfm['F_Score'] = pd.qcut(rfm['Frequency'].rank(method='first'), 5, labels = [1,2,3,4,5])

# Monetary score: Higher values indicate higher spending, so assign higher scores to higher monetary values
rfm['M_Score'] = pd.qcut(rfm['Monetary'], 5, labels = [1,2,3,4,5])

# Combine RFM scores into a single string to create the RFM segment
rfm['RFM_Score'] = rfm['R_Score'].astype(str) + rfm['F_Score'].astype(str) + rfm['M_Score'].astype(str)
rfm.head()
```

[Out 13]:

<img width="1050" alt="image"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/276f4aed-f305-4a3e-9d3c-9d0d4ad429c5" />


#### 🛠 Step 4: Calculate RFM Score

[In 14]:

```python
#Split the RFM Score column into a list
segmentation['RFM Score'] = segmentation['RFM Score'].astype(str).str.split(',')

#Explode (each score into a separate row)
segmentation = segmentation.explode('RFM Score')

#Remove whitespace from RFM_Score values
segmentation['RFM Score'] = segmentation['RFM Score'].str.strip()

#Merge segmentation into rfm
rfm = rfm.merge(segmentation, left_on="RFM_Score", right_on="RFM Score", how="left")

# After merging, remove the RFM column to prevent confusion
rfm = rfm.drop(columns=['RFM Score'])

#Generates the combined RFM_Score by concatenating the individual Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores into a single string.
rfm['RFM_Score'] = rfm['R_Score'].astype(str) + rfm['F_Score'].astype(str) + rfm['M_Score'].astype(str)
rfm
```

### Part C. Risk & Retention Analysis

Analyzing churn risk to identify customers who may require retention strategies.

#### 8. Churn Risk Scoring

Purpose: Identify customers with high probability of churn

Simple approach: Higher Recency → Higher churn risk

[In 25]:

```python
# Normalize Recency (scale between 0 and 1)
rfm['R_scaled'] = rfm['Recency'] / rfm['Recency'].max()

# Define churn score (higher Recency = higher risk)
rfm['Churn_Score'] = rfm['R_scaled']
```

#### 8.1 Customer Churn Risk Distribution

Visualize the distribution of churn risk among customers

[In 26]:

```python
# Churn Risk Distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))

<img width="1050" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d1fc3e-3139-4495-ad9c-c3cbf0d64873" />

#### 📌 Insight

- The churn risk distribution is right-skewed, with the majority of customers concentrated at **low churn scores (below 0.3)**, indicating a relatively stable customer base.

- However, a noticeable tail of customers exhibits **high churn risk (above 0.7)**, representing a vulnerable segment that may require immediate retention actions.

- Although smaller in size, this high-risk group could pose significant revenue impact if it overlaps with high-value segments.
  
- Overall, churn risk is not evenly distributed, highlighting the importance of targeted, segment-based retention strategies.

#### 8.2 Churn Risk by Customer Segment**

Evaluate which segments have the highest risk of churn

[In 27]:

```python
# Churn Risk by Segment
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))

sns.boxplot(
    x='Segment',
    y='Churn_Score',
    data=rfm,
    color=Brand_color
)


plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title("Churn Risk by Segment", fontsize=14, weight='bold')

#### 📌 Insight  


- High-value customers (larger bubbles) are concentrated in the **low Recency – high Frequency** zone, indicating that recent and frequent buyers drive the majority of revenue.  

- A large portion of customers cluster in the **high Recency – low Frequency** area, suggesting a substantial inactive or low-engagement base.  

- Revenue distribution is uneven, with a small group of active customers generating disproportionately higher monetary value.


#### 11. Segment Priority Matrix

This chart compares customer share vs revenue share of each segment. Bubble size represents total revenue.

Helps identify high-value segments that generate disproportionate revenue

[In 30]:

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Segment Summary
segment_summary = (
    rfm.groupby('Segment')
    .agg(Customer_Count=('CustomerID','count'),
         Revenue=('Monetary','sum'))
    .reset_index())

segment_summary['Customer_Share'] = segment_summary['Customer_Count'] / segment_summary['Customer_Count'].sum()
segment_summary['Revenue_Share'] = segment_summary['Revenue'] / segment_summary['Revenue'].sum()

bubble_size = segment_summary['Revenue'] / segment_summary['Revenue'].max() * 2000

# Segment Priority Matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))

x = segment_summary['Customer_Share'] * 100
y = segment_summary['Revenue_Share'] * 100
plt.scatter(x, y, s=bubble_size, alpha=0.7, color="#2E86C1")

# Labels
texts = [
    plt.text(x[i], y[i], segment_summary['Segment'][i], fontsize=10)
    for i in range(len(segment_summary))]

adjust_text(texts)

# Quadrant reference lines
plt.axhline(y.mean(), linestyle='--', alpha=0.6)
plt.axvline(x.mean(), linestyle='--', alpha=0.6)

# Axis & Title
plt.xlabel("Customer Share (%)")
