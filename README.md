# 1️⃣ 📌 Background & Overview

## 🎯 Objective

### 📖 What is this project about?

The **Marketing team** aims to launch **personalized campaigns** for **customer retention and acquisition** during peak sales periods. However, with a dataset exceeding **540,000+ transactions**, manual segmentation is no longer feasible.

To address this challenge, the **RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** is applied using **Python (Google Colab)** to systematically classify customers based on purchasing behavior.

This project covers:

- Data preparation & preprocessing  
- RFM score calculation  
- Customer segmentation  
- Data visualization  
- Actionable business recommendations  

---

### 👤 Who is this project for?

✔️ **Marketing Department**  
✔️ **Sales Team**  
✔️ **Business Decision-Makers & Stakeholders**

---

## ❓ Business Questions

- How can we **segment customers effectively** using the RFM model?  
- Which customer groups should be **prioritized for retention and promotional campaigns**?  
- What actionable insights can improve **marketing performance and engagement**?  
- What strategies should be applied to **different customer segments** to maximize value?

## 🔎 RFM Analysis Overview

### Why use RFM?

**RFM (Recency – Frequency – Monetary)** is a proven customer analysis framework used to evaluate purchasing behavior and customer value.

Each customer is assigned a score based on:

- **Recency** → How recently did the customer make a purchase?  
- **Frequency** → How often does the customer purchase?  
- **Monetary** → How much does the customer spend?  

By applying RFM, businesses can:

- Identify **high-value customers**
- Detect **at-risk customers**
- Optimize **marketing targeting strategies**
- Improve **customer lifetime value (CLV)**
